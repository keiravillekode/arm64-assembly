# Learning

ARM64 assembly is a simple assembly language.
You might be able to start off with [a reference sheet][reference-sheet].

ARM also provides [digital reference][official-reference] on the ARM64 (AArch64/ARMv8) architecture.

We hope you enjoy learning ARM assembly and working through the exercises.

This is a gateway to getting to know your phone or ARM64 based development hardware (the more recent Raspberry Pi models are an example).
